With this file you can create a copy of the linkin-it-all page using a path of your choice, in this case /linkinbio.

You can then link to this page from outside this website, from your online profiles.

Why would you want this? Maybe later on you want to create another website with more than just this page.
You can then have a page in that website similar to this page, that all your profiles link to and have another page on your homepage.

The page at / will still be created. To prevent duplicate content isses with google and other search engines
the canonical link will link to this page.

The functionality to create the canonical link depends on this file being named linkinbio.md, so do not move or rename this file.
To generate it with a different path use the path field above.
